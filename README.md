## nextjs-app-dir-starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project starter repo with app-dir [`nextjs-app-dir-starter`](https://github.com/bezzietech/nextjs-app-dir-starter).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

```bash
npm run build
```

Check the build before commiting and push any code.
